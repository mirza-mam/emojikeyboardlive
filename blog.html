<h3>Keyboard Emoji Symbols: </h3>

As explained above, emojis are not only smileys that you can use to express your emotions. The concept of emoji goes way beyond that. You have food emojis, flag emojis (to represent your country) and the list goes on. One of the emoji categories that deserves special attention is “Symbols”. This category, like all others, can be used during casual conversations but what makes it stand out is that its purpose is not limited to that. 

The Symbols category can be used for other important purposes as well such as spreading awareness (with the help of traffic signs), giving directions and denoting mathematical equations. The best way to teach people about something important is by incorporating the lessons into something they love, and emojis are loved by, without a doubt, majority of the internet users.

Getting emojis on MAC is not that difficult as some people have assumed. Although there are a number of ways to insert emojis into your texts, the easiest one has got to be if you own one of the latest released MacBook Pros that comes with a Touch Bar. 

The Touch Bar will display an option that will enable you to use emojis in your conversations or anywhere else that allows typing. You can also check out the emojis you have used recently and sometimes, you will also be suggested an emoji that is the related with the word you have typed just before.

There is a copy button, which displays “Copied” once an emoji is copied. The same button is also used for manually doing it.
